Please accept this letter and the attached resume as an indication of my interest to join Gitlab as a Senior Security Engineer. I find the work that Gitlab is doing to be very interesting, and as the company grows, I believe that I am uniquely positioned to help with the expansion of your Security Operations team, and the formalization of its processes.

I was previously employed at Amazon Web Services, where I worked on both the Data Center and Security Operations teams. In these roles, I was required to make good judgements quickly, and often had to revise strategies as new data came in. Furthermore, as these roles were often at the forefront of the business, I took responsibility for distilling and documenting new procedures for events not previously encountered.

I am a dedicated Information Technology Generalist, and as such, I am passionate about expanding my knowledge in all areas of IT, including soft skills. I take pride in the fact that I have the knowledge required to architect and secure systems from the ground up; however, I also know effective communication is a necessity for success. I have found that my ability to communicate clearly, both to teammates and across teams, has generally been more important than knowing which buttons to push.

I have recently returned from a work hiatus. During this time, I not only traveled the world, but was able to maintain and expand on my skills. I successfully completed two certifications, and learned about serverless architecture by maintaining a blog documenting our journey. I also learned first hand that the mere use of language is not all there is to communication, especially if you are communicating with someone from a different culture. 

I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience. I have also attached my resume, which gives a more detailed breakdown of my skills and education. I appreciate your consideration thus far, and look forward to discussing this position with you.
